pslf_message = """ Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) tends to be the most commonly known federal student loan forgiveness program. Some also call it the “Obama Forgiveness Program” although you should note that nobody with any real knowledge of the student loan programs will ever call it that. In fact, this misnomer is one of the clues we use to identify potential student loan scams. You should too.

                   To be eligible to get the balance of your loan forgiven under PSLF, the borrower will need to make 120 payments, on eligible loans, while working full time for an eligible employer. It’s important to note that all three of these things have to happen at the same time. Once you complete the 120 payments, the balance of your loans are forgiven, tax free."""
